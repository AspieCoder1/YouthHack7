# Winter Olympics - Brawler

This game was made in pygame and was the winning response to the winter olympics challenge at YouthHack # 7, part of the Hack Manchester event lineup

Disclamer: this was our first time using pygame so we know the code is shit and the project layout is distgusting. What I am trying ton say is please be nice.
