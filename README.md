# Winter Olympics - Brawler

This game was made in pygame and was the winning response to the winter olympics challenge at YouthHack # 7, part of the Hack Manchester event line up. I enjoyed this project as the with this team I had not really worked with many of them before and I thought are finished project was quite cool.

Disclaimer: this was our first time using pygame so we know the code is shit and the project layout is disgusting. What I am trying to say is please be nice.
